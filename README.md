# FaceDetecting
A small little project I made for detecting faces, or other objects depends on wat datasets you input and because of Deep Learning And ML and use of different libraries and API It is possible to do Real-Time Detection
Refer to the Notes and steps in the code


Make sure to add the correct file paths and that you have all the needed libraries installed in your virtual enviroment where you are running the code.
Also make sure you have the correct version of everything or else things will get messy
